Silhouet: Privacy-First Social Perception & Signal Platform
Overview

Silhouet is a privacy-first, analytics-driven social platform designed to surface what people believe, perceive, and experience — without exposing their personal identities or raw content. Instead of showing posts or direct 
conversations, the platform distills aggregate insights from user behavior, personality metrics, and expressed claims. These insights can be used for social awareness, targeted messaging, and research — without compromising user 
privacy.

The core vision:

Amplify shared perceptions that may otherwise be suppressed.

Measure trust, sentiment, and societal shifts at multiple geographic and demographic levels.

Enable targeted communication for advertisers and public-interest groups, while ensuring absolute privacy.

Core Principles

No PII (Personally Identifiable Information) Once registered, there’s no public or backend-accessible way to link a specific post to a specific user account. Aggregation and cohort-based reporting ensure no individual is 
identifiable.

Cohort-First Data Model The smallest geographical cohort is a zipcode. Higher cohorts (city, district, state, country, global) are computed from lower ones, with cohort-level gating to ensure only sufficiently corroborated signals 
propagate upward.

Pull-Only Delivery The backend never “pushes” content to users. Clients request updates (scores, ads, insights) only while active. This reduces backend load, avoids unnecessary session tracking, and makes ad/insight impression 
counting simple and accurate.

Perception over Truth Insights reflect what people believe or claim, not whether those beliefs are factually correct. This avoids editorial judgment and allows the platform to capture genuine perception shifts — which are socially 
valuable even when incorrect.

Platform Components 1. Personality & Sentiment Scoring

Every post is scored along 53 predefined psychological and sentiment dimensions using a robust NLP pipeline.

Scores are aggregated by cohort, producing a continuous picture of personality and sentiment distribution across geographies and demographics.

2. Insights

Insights are broadcast messages generated from two sources:

Post-based insights: Extracted from user assertions at the zipcode level via a multi-stage funnel.

Cohort-based insights: Generated by bubbling up lower-level insights if they meet cohort gating thresholds (e.g., 10% of the cohort’s registered users corroborate the claim).

Insights can be:

Simple statistical summaries: “X% of users in {cohort} show {parameter} above global average.”

Comparative: “Users in {cohort1} score Y% higher in {parameter} than {cohort2}.”

Claim-based: “X% of users in {cohort} claim {socially relevant assertion}.”

Claim Candidate Funnel:

Collect all assertions from posts.

Remove preferences unless containing socially relevant keywords.

Remove non-relevant events.

Keep the rest; apply cohort gating to filter noise.

Privacy Note: No raw post content is shown. Only aggregated, anonymized statements are surfaced.

3. Ads

Ads are targeted messages with defined cohorts or filters (e.g., “all users scoring >0.7 in anxiety”).

Advertisers define campaigns with:

Target filters (demographic/psychological/geographical).

Media URLs (served directly from CDN/S3).

Duration & frequency constraints.

Ads and insights share the same delivery pipeline:

Messages with a targets field → rendered in ad slot.

Messages without targets → rendered in insights slot.

4. Messaging & Delivery

Redis-backed queue system.

FIFO message serving with optional prioritization at the worker level.

Separate ads_worker and insights_worker, both writing to a common message queue.

Clients pull /serve endpoint for the next message.

Optional client acknowledgement for delivery tracking.

5. Cohort Gating

Prevents irrelevant noise from flooding higher cohorts.

Thresholds are percentage of total registered users in a cohort, not just active posters.

Example:

10% of zipcode users repeat an assertion → becomes a zipcode insight.

If enough zipcodes in a city have a similar insight that meets the city’s threshold → bubbles up as a city insight.

Works like a social relevance filter — only sufficiently corroborated beliefs reach broader audiences.

Key Innovations

Crowdsourced Whistleblowing Safely amplifies suppressed or dangerous-to-speak claims without linking them to individuals, e.g., “X% of users in {constituency} claim electoral malpractice.”

Signal Amplification via Semantic Aggregation Similar statements are grouped using semantic clustering (not just keyword matching), ensuring that variations in wording still contribute to the same underlying signal.

Cohort-Level Insight Generation Prevents trivial local events from flooding national/global insights, while ensuring genuinely large-scale perceptions do propagate.

Dual-Use Messaging Infrastructure One unified pipeline serves both ads and insights, simplifying backend complexity and enabling advertisers to operate within the same delivery model as organic insights.

Potential Applications

Public Policy: Detect early signs of societal unrest, distrust in institutions, or shifting cultural sentiment.

Market Research: Identify emerging trends in consumer psychology without invasive tracking.

Activism & Journalism: Surface corroborated claims that might otherwise be ignored or silenced.

Mental Health Outreach: Identify high-anxiety or high-risk cohorts for targeted support campaigns.

Why Now?

Growing distrust in traditional social platforms due to privacy breaches and algorithmic manipulation.

Increasing need for authentic, representative societal metrics untainted by social media’s incentive structures.

Advances in NLP make semantic clustering and claim extraction practical at scale.

Next Development Milestones

Finalize insight generation pipeline (claim extraction, semantic aggregation, cohort gating).

Integrate ad/insight unified delivery into frontend.

Advertiser campaign management backend (filters, rotations, duration logic).

Frontend dashboard for advertisers & researchers to explore aggregate insights.# Silhouet Antisocial network.
